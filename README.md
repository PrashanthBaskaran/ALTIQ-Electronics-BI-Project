Data Set:
The data set was gathered from a certification program. The program conducted a Power BI contest, the data set was released along with the problem statement.

Desired Insights:
- For the past three years, ALTIQ Electronics has experienced a net profit loss. The stakeholders desired an operational dashboard to ascertain the causes of the loss and evaluate them over time against the competitors.
- The dashboard should contain five separate dashboards that offer insights from the perspectives of sales, executive, finance, marketing, and executive. These dashboards are used to improve various departments by concentrating on them.
- These dashboards ought to offer information for various products and regions in addition to P&L statements.

Process:
- The goal of the project was to create a entire dashboard for the stakeholders at ALTIQ Electronics that could be easily accessible with a home screen containing different dashboards.
- The homepage was made in such a way that, it was a one click away from any view that was needed by the stakeholders.
- Every view/dashboard had the slicer for comparing between the years. ALTIQ electronics was founded in 2019. The project provides the comparison between all these years with the estimated revenue in 2022.
- Every view also had slicer to indicate the performance based on Last Year as well as the Target for next year.
- Key performance indicators were created to provide an overall picture for the stakeholders.

Key Insights & Suggestions to the Stakeholders from the Project:
1. While ALTIQ was concentrating on building the business into one of the titans of the electronics sector, it neglected to maintain track of its ongoing operating costs.
2. The post-invoice deductions, such as discounts during the holidays and slotting fees, had an impact on the net profit %.
3. The company's top-selling segments were notebooks, peripherals, and desktops, however the supply chain perspective shows that the forecast accuracy for these goods wasn't computed correctly, resulting in an OOS (Out of stock) problem.
